# Dev Container

## Mac Setup

Prerequisites:

- Docker
- VSCode
- [VSCode Remote Containers plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation)

If you receive a message saying `A mount config is invalid. Make sure it has the right format and as source folder that exists on the machine where the Docker daemon is running.` check that you have the following folders `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` - if either of these are missing you will need to create them with `mkdir` or via the Finder.

## Ubuntu Setup

Install Docker (Ubuntu)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

Add yourself to docker users

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
docker run hello-world
```

Test it

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Reboot, then test your own user

```bash
sudo reboot now
```

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## Debugging/FAQs

- Current configuration of devcontainer mounts in credentials from the parent system's ~/.aws and ~/.ssh directories. If these do not exist, `docker run` command that runs on container startup will fail (due to not being able to mount these directories into the container).

## Local AWS environment

Localstack has been installed into the devcontainer and will start automatically. You should be able to verify localstack is running by using the `make aws-local-status` command in terminal.
